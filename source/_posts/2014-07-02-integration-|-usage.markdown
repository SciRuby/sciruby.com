Numerical Integration
---------------------
Integration is the process of finding the summation of the value of a function at small intervals, when the width of the intervals is infinitesimally small. 
As there is no such thing as infinitesimally small interval, there are several other methods which help us to approximate the values of integrals. Numerical integration is one such technique which helps us to find out the approximate value of the integral of a function over an interval.
Numerical integration is based on the principle of evaluating the values of a function at specific points in the interval and then taking the product of those values with a corresponding weight, which is a standard constant specific to the method being used.

Integration Gem
---------------
The integration gem is now equipped with a host of different algorithms for approximating the integral of a function ranging from the simple ones like Simpson's method to the more complex ones like Gauss Kronrod and Adaptive Quadrature method. 

Example

Let us say you need to find out the integration of a function
