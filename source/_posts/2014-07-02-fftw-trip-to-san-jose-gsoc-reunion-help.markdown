## I won the lottery!

Entry to attend the Google Summer of Code 10 year Reunion meet up in San Jose CA, USA!!!!!11

![Intense celebration time!][1]

This trip is the opportunity to meet face-to-face with other FOSS community! The event is being held in October 23-26, 2014.
### However

> I learned that the windfall was just the invitation. I live in Edinburgh, Scotland and I will still need to pay all this stuff before I am able to use my reunion invitation

> **Hotel** room, Incidentals (meals at the airport, souvenirs, hotel room food.
> **Airfare**, cab rides, etc. from the airports to the reunion
> **Transportation** to SFO or SJC if the 15:45 shuttle departure

Which looks set to cost an awful lot…

#### **Problem**
I live in **Edinburgh, Scotland.** As a student, I have no money either!

![Hopes, deleted.][2]
#### **Solution**
Money, **you give**?

### Why **Give?**
In 2013 I [implemented caret and focus tracking for GNOME](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2013/Projects/MagdalenBernsCaretAndFocusTracking). An accessibility feature, which was planned around 3 years prior to my taking on the internship which saw it implemented.

![GNOME][3] ![SciRuby][4]
This summer I am delighted to be able to work with the SciRuby team by implementing a [FFTW3 wrapper for Ruby now, too](http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/06/04/introducing-the-fftw-sciruby-gsoc-project). I am working with a great team and I also have a very talented and awesome mentor in Colin Fuller too :-).
![SciRuby][5] ![FFTW][6]

By helping me meet all the wonderful people I have worked with in person, at the  [Google Summer of Code 10 year Reunion](https://sites.google.com/site/gsocmentorsummitstudentreunion/home), San Jose, you will also be helping to grow the open source community!
