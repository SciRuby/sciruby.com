<p>Ruby has for some time had no equivalent to the beautifully constructed numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries for Python. We believe that the time for a Ruby science and visualization package has come and gone. Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is, we believe, with the need for numeric and visualization libraries in Ruby.</p>

<p>We are not the first with this idea, but we are trying to bring it to life.</p>

<p>At this point, SciRuby has not much to offer. But if you install this gem, you&#8217;ll get as dependencies all of the libraries that we plan to incorporate into SciRuby.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<pre><code>(sudo) gem install sciruby
</code></pre>

<h2 id="developers">Developers</h2>

<p>After checking out the source, run:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake newb
