<p class="warning">The current version of NMatrix is <strong>0.0.3</strong>.</p>

NMatrix is a fast numerical linear algebra library for Ruby, written mostly in C++. It can be used with or without SciRuby, but is part of the SciRuby project.

You can find [API documentation here]({{ root_url }}/nmatrix/docs) and the code [in the Github repository](http://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix/).

Don't forget to take a [look at the wiki](http://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix/wiki), where you can find some useful guides and tutorials to help you start using NMatrix!

NMatrix was inspired by, and originally based heavily upon, [NArray](http://narray.rubyforge.org) by Masahiro Tanaka.
