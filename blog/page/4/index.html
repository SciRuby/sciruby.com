<p>I&#8217;m writing this blog post for SciRuby, but I&#8217;m really writing it for the young women out there. SciRuby is applying to
participate in <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/">Google&#8217;s Code-In 2013</a>, which aims to get high school
students involved in the open source movement, and specifically in coding. It&#8217;s great preparation for college and
beyond — whatever you might choose to study.</p>

<p>I became involved in science because I love figuring stuff out and working with smart, interesting people, and I want
you to get involved, too. Modern science wouldn&#8217;t be possible without open source software. Moreover, if you learn how
to code, you&#8217;ll always have a job. Always.</p>

<p>And the cool part is that you don&#8217;t have to know how to code in order to participate. Many of the tasks involve research
and documentation in science and mathematics — which is a great way to obtain valuable experience for college
applications.</p>

Code 2013 students&#8217; work. I edited it to include a very incomplete list of public RDF repositories. &mdash;John Woods</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Across all fields and disciplines, contemporary scientists are faced with a massive and growing volume of data. It often
won&#8217;t fit in a lab notebook, and there is a pressing need to share it more quickly and widely than publication in a
journal article would allow for. Database software is one great solution for storage of such data, but relational
databases become brittle in the face of changes or new information, do not play nicely with other databases or data
derived from such databases, and may not be fully machine (or human) readable without pre-existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Internet is an extremely useful place to discover and share useful information, but it is essentially
built around linked documents, rather than pure data, and so our primary mechanism for sharing data is as HTML or text.</p>

<p>RDF and related technologies propose to provide the means to move beyond a web of documents to a web of data. Along
the way, these technologies may address many of the problems with conventional relational databases (e.g., SQL). At its
core, RDF defines an extremely flexible method for representing data on the web &mdash; which is nonetheless
unambiguously defined, without any external context, and can be linked to other data as web documents link to each
other. Because RDF data can be understood as either a set of subject&ndash;predicate&ndash;object statements or a
directed graph with labeled edges, a number of supporting standards and tools that have grown up around it to provide
powerful storage and access methods that are often easier to implement and use than those associated with relational
databases and the document-based web.</p>

<h2>Enter PubliSci</h2>

<p>This summer I created a Ruby gem, <a href="http://github.com/sciruby/publisci">PubliSci</a>, to facilitate data publication and interaction using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web">Semantic Web</a>. The format offers a unified way to share and combine
information from multiple sources, support for machine learning tools,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">flexible query language</a> that makes application integration easy, and the
backing of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards-setting bodies.</p>

<p>The PubliSci gem comprises a set of parsers for converting various input formats using
the <a href="http://semanticweb.com/w3c-publishes-last-call-working-drafts-for-rdf-data-cube-dcat_b35950">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a>, and
a Ruby interface for defining new ones. Since the relationship between external datasets and semantic web formats is
sometimes up to interpretation, a domain-specific language is included to allow end users to resolve ambiguities and
provide additional metadata.</p>

<p>Along with the conversion tool, a standalone server is available as an extension to the gem that simplifies setting up and interacting
with RDF data stores. The server allows import, export, querying, and management of external <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">triplestores</a> such as
<a href="http://4store.org/">4store</a>, and supports both cross-domain access and content negotiation so the gem can be accessed
using Javascript or other applications.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Triplestores</strong> are databases for the storage and retrieval of <strong>triples</strong>,
which are typically subject&ndash;object&ndash;predicate relationships (e.g., <i>Bob knows Fred</i>).</p>


<p>If you&#8217;d like to contribute, the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/publisci">source code is available on Github</a>, and <a href="http://gsocsemantic.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/bio-publisci/">a broad
outline of the to do list can be had as well</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done <code>gem install publisci</code>, you can require the gem in the normal way (<code>require 'publisci'</code>). To invoke the
domain-specific language, you&#8217;ll also want to include the <code>DSL</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>require 'publisci'
include PubliSci::DSL
</code></pre>

<p>Input data can be specified like so:</p>

<pre><code># Specify input data
data do
  # Use local or remote paths to point to the data file you want to load:
  source 'https://github.com/wstrinz/publisci/raw/master/spec/csv/bacon.csv'

  # Specify datacube properties.
  dimension 'producer', 'pricerange'
  measure 'chunkiness'

  # Set parser-specific options.
  option 'label_column', 'producer'
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can provide meta-data on your dataset as well.</p>

<pre><code>metadata do
  dataset 'bacon'
  title 'Bacon dataset'
  creator 'Will Strinz'
  description 'some data about bacon'
  date '1-10-2010'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sending the data to a repository is simple.</p>

<pre><code># Send output to an RDF::Repository
#  can also use 'generate_n3' to output a turtle string
repo = to_repository
</code></pre>

<p>SPARQL queries can be run on the dataset using the <code>QueryHelper</code> module.</p>

<pre><code># run SPARQL queries on the dataset
PubliSci::QueryHelper.execute('select * where {?s ?p ?o} limit 5', repo)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, data can be exported in other formats, such as ARFF:</p>

<pre><code># export in other formats
PubliSci::Writers::ARFF.new.from_store(repo)
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p class="note"><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This is the first of four blog posts detailing
our Google Summer of Code 2013 students&#8217; work, edited by John Woods.</p>


<p>In the context of the Google Summer of Code 2013, I have developed a Ruby gem called <a href="https://github.com/arrigonialberto86/ruby-band">Ruby Band</a>
that makes some selected Java software for data mining and machine learning applications available to the JRuby/Ruby
users. This project complements existing software already developed for SciRuby by adding support for the Weka Toolkit
and general functions included in the Apache Commons Math library.</p>

<p>As Weka does, Ruby Band features a comprehensive collection of data preprocessing and modeling techniques, and supports
several standard data mining tasks, more specifically: data pre-processing (filtering), clustering, classification,
regression, and feature selection.</p>

<p>All of Ruby Band&#8217;s techniques have been built on the assumption that the data is
available as a single flat file or relation, where each datum is described by a fixed number of attributes. The
loaded datasets are stored in Weka Instances objects, which are used as &#8216;core&#8217; data types for the interactions with
other software (Apache Commons Math) or platforms.</p>

<p>Originally, Ruby Band was called Ruby Mining. I renamed it Ruby Band, as I imagine
different software sources (Weka, Apache, etc.) working as a whole, like in a real band. Ruby Band has been designed
with a modular structure, so that it can be easily extended and integrated with other Java software. The Core module is
allows data types from different sources to be defined and integrated using converter methods;
functionalities from each piece of additional software are independently imported. This structure increases the
extensibility of the product, as in the future other developers may add functionalities according to their needs.</p>

<p>Though Ruby Band provides full support for the greatest part of the Weka APIs, some topics still need to be addressed
properly. As I coded, I utilized the Weka Java APIs documentation as my roadmap; if you want to contribute,
<a href="http://weka.wikispaces.com/Use+WEKA+in+your+Java+code">go see what is still missing</a>. The best and easiest way
to introduce a new functionality into the Ruby Band framework is to write up a pertinent Cucumber test, as a number of
Weka recipes have been posted online by the creators.</p>

<p>The beta version of Ruby Band has already been released for general use on Rubygems (<code>gem install ruby-band</code>).</p>

<p>This is a quick example of how to train a classifier on a dataset parsed from an ARFF file:</p>

<pre><code>require 'ruby-band'

# parse a dataset
dataset = Core::Parser.parse_ARFF(my_file.arff)

# initialize and train a classifier
classifier = Weka::Classifier::Lazy::KStar::Base.new do
  set_options '-M d'
  set_data dataset
  set_class_index 4
end

# cross-validate the trained classifier
puts classifier.cross_validate(3)
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of this writing, NMatrix v0.0.9 is available on RubyGems. It is likely that the next version will be a beta release
candidate, as there&#8217;s only one critical feature still missing (<code>==</code> between matrices of different storage types).</p>

<p>An enormous amount has changed since my last entry.</p>

<h2>New, friendlier constructor</h2>

<p>First and foremost, NMatrix sports a new constructor, based
on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sciruby-dev/tPwnmPbRR_U/PL0Nc92gdzEJ">helpful comments from folks on the listserv</a>. Here
are some examples of construction:</p>

<pre><code>NMatrix.new([4,4], 0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :int32, all 0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :float64, all 0.0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0, dtype: :complex64) # 4x4 dense matrix of :complex64
NMatrix.new([1,4], stype: :yale) # size 4 sparse (Yale) row vector of 0s
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2]) # 4 rows, 3 columns: gradient across each row from 0 to 2 (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2], stype: :yale, default: 0) # same as above, but Yale storage (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,1], stype: :list, dtype: :rational128) # size 4 sparse (list) column vector of rational 0s
NMatrix.new([4,4]) # 4x4 dense matrix containing nils
NMatrix.new([4,4], dtype: :int64) # 4x4 uninitialized dense matrix containing 64-bit integers
NMatrix.new(4)     # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>The different storage types (stypes) have slightly different behaviors when no initialization value is provided. This
may change in the future, but addresses the somewhat different use-cases of these storage types.</p>

<p>I show a variety of examples above, several of which are not particularly wise uses &#8212; for example, the <code>[0,1,2]</code> Yale
gradient, which uses 32-bit integers and must store 11 column indices and pointers (which are most likely unsigned
long integers) in addition to the 11 entries (4 for the always-stored diagonal, 1 for the default, and 6 for the
non-diagonal non-zeros).</p>

<p>The key to understanding the differing construction is the default value. All sparse matrices need a default. Usually we
think of sparse matrices as being zero-based (only non-zero values are stored), but NMatrix now allows other defaults.
However, dense matrices don&#8217;t need defaults, and in fact sometimes it&#8217;s more efficient to allocate them without
initializing them &#8212; such as if they&#8217;re about to store the results of some LAPACK function call. But if they contain
Ruby objects, they <strong>have</strong> to be initialized, which is why they become nil.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re still working out a few bugs in construction. If you find any, please report them in our <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Elimination of NVectors</h2>

<p>We removed the NVector class. Frankly, it didn&#8217;t make sense. A vector can&#8217;t have an orientation unless it has multiple
dimensions &#8212; even if some of those dimensions have length 1. Now, vectors and matrices are treated the same in the code.</p>

<p>The good news is that element access (<code>[]</code>) has been rewritten so that the programmer only needs provide the coordinates
whose dimensions are not 1. For example:</p>

<pre><code>n = NMatrix.new([4,1,3], 0) # 3-dimensional matrix of 0s
n[2,1] == n[2,0,1]
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The same rule applies to slicing.</p>

<h2>Slicing improvements</h2>

<p>Aleksey Timin contributed the framework for matrix slicing. Matrices can be sliced by copying or by reference. Modifying
a copy-slice does not modify the original matrix; but modifying a reference slice does.</p>

<p>A copy of some portion of the matrix may be made using <code>NMatrix#slice</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new_matrix = n.slice(0..1,0..2)
</code></pre>

<p>And what appears to be a copy, but is actually a reference, may be made using brackets:</p>

<pre><code>ref = n[0..1,0..2]
</code></pre>

<p>Reference slices may also be modified in a variety of ways:</p>

<pre><code>n[0..4,2..8] = 0   # change all entries to 0
n[0..4,2..8] = [0,1,2]  # change the selected entries to [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2...]
n[0..4,2..8] = NMatrix.new([3,3], [0,1,2]) # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of speed, each of these <code>[]=</code> returns the right-hand value, whether that value is an array, matrix, or
single value. So, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = m[0..4,2..8] = n[0..1,0..2] = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>x</code> will be equal to <code>[1,2,3]</code> after the evaluation.</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p>Matrices are now enumerable. There are a variety of enumerators &#8212; namely <code>each_with_indices</code> (and <code>each</code>), <code>each_stored_with_indices</code>,
and <code>each_ordered_stored_with_indices</code>. The first, <code>each</code>, is guaranteed to produce the same iteration regardless of the
storage type. The other two iterate only across the stored entries.</p>

<h2>Elementwise comparisons</h2>

<p>A regular matrix comparison, returning a single boolean, can be accomplished using <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>. In earlier versions of
NMatrix, the results of the element-wise versions, <code>=~</code>, <code>!~</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>, were matrices of 0s and 1s,
stored using the <code>:byte</code> dtype.</p>

<p>Now, these comparisons return matrices of Ruby objects:</p>

<pre><code>n &lt; m
=&gt; [ true,  false, false, true,
     false, false, false, true,
     true,  true,  true,  true  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Try experimenting with sparse matrices to see how the default value (<code>#default_value</code>) is initialized on the result during an
elementwise comparison.</p>

<h2>Chunky bacon</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about all of the chunky bacon in our latest release. I feel like things are really coming together
for our library. I&#8217;m also glad to see that people are using it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of using NMatrix yourself, I strongly encourage it. Although I&#8217;m writing my dissertation, I plan to
prioritize troubleshooting ahead of just about everything else. I want using NMatrix to be an easy choice for every
Rubyist.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

We were incredibly pleased to be able to offer so many fellowships, made possible in part by the generosity of an anonymous contributor. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Activity has picked up enormously on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev">our listserv</a> over the last few weeks,
which makes us all very happy.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chriswailes">Chris Wailes</a> and I have been working on a major refactoring of <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix">NMatrix</a>,
our replacement for NArray. You may recall that we released our first alpha (0.0.1) back in April, and that we&#8217;ve been
relatively silent since then.</div>
