<div class="entry-content"><p>Many popular programming languages these days ship with powerful Time
classes/interfaces to make the inevitable task of dealing with
time-related computations a more DRY experience. Humans like their
time representations to be stringy concatenations of various numbers
and alphabets that enable a large variety of date and time formats to
mean the same thing and still make instant sense to the human eye. It
was the creation of time zones that made our convenient 24-hour clocks
stay the way they are without experiencing day and night at the same
&#8220;time&#8221; across the globe. So now <code>00:00 A.M. UTC</code> is <code>5:30 A.M. IST</code>
for me, and the world remains sane.</p>

<p>But what happens when you accept the fact that you&#8217;re just a speck of
micro-dust adjusting time relatively for an only slightly bigger speck
of dust floating in the universe? Twenty-four hours in a day and thus we reset
after 2300, but consider: how would a resident of Venus know
when tea-time is on Venus if he had an Earth wristwatch that reset
after twenty-four hours? Barely a tenth of Venus&#8217; day is complete in that time!
(If you know anybody intent on relocating to Mars, do not gift them a
clock or watch.)</p>

<p>So a decimal floating point representation must be the answer for
uniformity. Time zones can be dealt with; we&#8217;ll just pick a convenient
point in time and count the seconds from there onwards so that the
location on Earth doesn&#8217;t matter henceforth. It&#8217;ll drive humans insane
with the arithmetic but machines will work just fine with this. This
sort of a time system is called epoch time.</p>

<p>And so the internal time of most UNIX machines is the number of
seconds after midnight on <code>Thursday, 1 January 1970 UTC</code>. (And this
very convention is going to open a can of worms by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">2038</a> if there is even a small set of critical machines
that haven&#8217;t moved on from 32-bit architectures.)</p>

<p>But we&#8217;re still not okay universally. Try going on an infinite journey
to space and you&#8217;ll find that counting seconds leads to some
inconsistencies with your local time when you try to synchronize with
Earth. How can the number of seconds after January 1970 be different
in any case? Well, your MacBook Pro has not been adjusted for
&#8230; relativity! Gravity bends light and thus the perception of
time. There&#8217;s a lot more mass, and thus a lot more gravitatonal fields
in neighborhoods away from Earth. The exact details of how this works
is beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<p>If the past few paragraphs were incessant and seemingly irrelevant,
they were there to drive home the point that Earth time simply will
not do when we step out of the ghetto to see what&#8217;s happening. But
astronomy&#8217;s been around for way longer, and astrophysicists came
forth with a time system adjusted for the relativity effects of the
solar system, called Barycentric Dynamical Time, or <em>TDB</em>. Like our
machines, it counts the seconds after a certain known reference time
point, except that it adjusts for relativity and can become a standard
for astronomical time.</p>

<p>There are many similar time scales like this, but SPICE has chosen to
use TDB as the standard for most of their design. Within the SPICE
API, TDB is the same as <em>Ephemeris Time</em> which is the main system used
to specify time points of astronomical bodies. Even though spacecrafts
have their clocks coordinated with UTC on Earth, you would require
that time in Ephemeris Time to be able to calculate their positions and
velocities using SPICE. <code>SpiceRub::Time</code> is built for this very purpose,
to revolve around a main attribute <code>@et</code> for Ephemeris Time and
provide many methods to convert to and from.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to proceed with the examples, you&#8217;ll need a Leap Second
Kernel file to use <code>SpiceRub::Time</code>. This is a generic kernel, so you
can easily use <code>naif0011.tls</code> in <code>spec/data/kernels</code> of the repository
folder.</p>

<p>So Ephemeris Time is the number of seconds elapsed after <code>Noon, January 1, 2000, TDB</code>. This point in time is also known as the <code>J2000</code>
epoch. We find that out in an instant by using the <code>Time.parse</code>
function which is a wrapper function for SPICE&#8217;s <code>str2et_c</code> that
converts many formats of strings to <code>Ephemeris Time</code>. You can have a
look at the various string formats supported in its documentation
<a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/str2et_c.html">here</a></p>

<p>So as a base case, using the reference epoch gives us 0 seconds as we would expect. Now would also be a good time to find out the discrepancy in <code>UTC</code> as well.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So right away we know that UTC was 64-ish seconds off from TDB / ET at the time of the reference J2000 epoch. What would the difference be around right now?</p>

<p>Well, here&#8217;s a surprise, it&#8217;s 68.18 now. Before I explain why that is,
here is a brief overview of what the above code does:</p>

<p><code>Time.now</code> is a convenient way to specify your current UTC
timezone. It uses Ruby&#8217;s core <code>Time.now</code> method so this method is only
good if you&#8217;re working in UTC or Earth like Timezones. For a similar
purpose, the function <code>Time.from_time</code> let&#8217;s you create a SpiceRub
Time object from a Ruby Time object.</p>

<p>The <code>+/-</code> operators return a new Time object where the right operand
is added/subtracted to the left operand&#8217;s <code>@et</code> when it is a float or
integer. If a Time object is supplied , then it does the same with the
right operand&#8217;s ephemeris time instead. (Note that there really isn&#8217;t
a significant meaning to having a Time object whose @et is the
difference/sum of two other epochs, however you can increase a certain
epoch or decrease it by a constant offset of seconds)</p>

<p>In our case we used <code>#to_utc</code> to convert from ephemeris time to UTC,
and then the minus operator gave us a Time object that wasn&#8217;t really
an epoch, but a difference of two epochs, so using <code>#to_f</code> got us
exactly that.</p>

<p>It appears that UTC has changed by 4 seconds since 2000 with respect
to ephemeris time. This is actually the adjustment of &#8220;leap seconds&#8221;
that gets added to UTC to prevent it from falling too far behind other
time systems. (Humans really like to hack everything, don&#8217;t they?)</p>

<p>To verify this yourself, if you open up the kernel <code>naif0011.tls</code> in your
text editor and search for <code>DELTET/DELTA_AT</code>, you&#8217;ll find a list like
representation of the following sort :-</p>

<p>Here you can see that just before the year 2000, there were 32 leap
seconds added to UTC, and in 2015 when the last leap second was added,
there were 36. It&#8217;s an ongoing and indefinite process and so there
really is no way to account for leap second errors far in the future
for leap seconds that are yet to be added. As of now, the next
scheduled addition is in December, 2016.</p>

<p>Coming back to our Time object, let&#8217;s look at its basic
construction. One tricky task in the API was the option to specify
different epochs of reference in different time scales, like
International Atomic Time. As of now, <code>Time.new</code> requires that you
have kept your word of using the J2000 epoch and allows you to use a
named parameter <code>seconds:</code> for specifying the time scale. The use of
<code>scale</code> as a key was avoided as it sometimes is also used to refer to the
reference epoch used.</p>

<p><code>:tai</code> here refers to International Atomic Time. For a list of more
parameters and their keyword abbreviations, have a look at
<a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/unitim_c.html">this</a> SPICE documentation for the function that the
conversion is wrapped on top of.</p>

<p>But there is also a way to reference other epochs without doing the
manual conversions yourself, you can call the class method <code>Time.at</code>
to perform the same function as the constructor, with the option of a
different reference epoch. The resultant Time object will however have
its internal time referring to J2000.</p>

<p>A more readable way would involve step by step calculations, but that
would consume runtime resources everytime <code>Time.at</code> is called, so I&#8217;ve
basically pre-calculated the ephemeris times of the reference epochs
and subtracted them from the epoch.</p>

<p>Just a second short of heading into the next day, because we&#8217;ve added
86400 TDB seconds and converted the time into a UTC string.</p>

<p>There are some more functions provided to work in tandem with the
<code>Body</code> class that I&#8217;ll explain more about in the next blog post, but
this more or less covers the core of <code>SpiceRub:Time</code>. Till then,
thanks for reading.</p>
