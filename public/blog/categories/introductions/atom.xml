    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought I'd start by introducing myself. I'm the project director for SciRuby, and I'm a molecular biology doctoral
 student at the University of Texas. I work in the <a href="http://marcottelab.org/">Marcotte Lab</a>, and actually occupy the
 former desk (and lab hostname) of John Prince, another of the SciRuby project leads. <!--more--></p>

<p>In addition to working as a graduate student, I am a blogger and an offline political activist -- specifically, a
 community organizer. While I have contributed code to SciRuby already, and plan to continue, my main role here derives
 from my community organizing experience: <strong>I want <em>you</em> to get involved.</strong></p>

<p>In that vein, I have written <a href="/blog/2011/08/15/the-challenges-of-copyrights/">a fascinating (and humble) precautionary tale</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and if do you want to get involved, you can find us in #sciruby (Freenode.net), or you can come check out our
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev">Google Group</a>.</p>
