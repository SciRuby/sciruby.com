    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ncwit.org/blog/did-you-know-demographics-technical-women">Women make up 51% of the American workforce, and yet only 20% of software engineers are female.</a> Worldwide,
the situation is similar. <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/58218">In open source software engineering, the statistics are worse: only 1.5&ndash;5% are female.</a></p>

<p>One of the organizations which presented at the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit was the <a href="http://gnome.org/opw/">GNOME Foundation's Outreach Program for Women</a> (OPW). OPW is
similar to GSoC, except that OPW doesn't require its applicants to be
students &mdash; or know how to program when the coding period begins. The pay is competitive with GSoC. And of course,
only women can apply.</p>

<p>In the process of our Google Code-In 2013 application, I recruited several female mentors to work with female GCI
students &mdash; not a requirement, but I think it helps to have supportive people involved with whom one can identify. Unfortunately,
we weren't selected for the Code-In (not too disappointing given <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gci-announce/P73dzsxKdsM">the several venerable and accomplished organizations that were chosen</a>). But we want to have another go, this
time by applying for the Outreach Program for Women.</p>

<p>Here's where we need your help.</p>

<p>Work for a company that might want to support this goal? Show this to your boss. Have him or her get in touch with
us (sciruby.project at gmail dot com).</p>

<p>If you don't work for such a company, but would still like to help, you can also get in touch at the same email address.
As a general rule of thumb, <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/15783">you can always donate via Pledgie</a>, even if you don't
have access to tons of money.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="/blog/2013/10/25/mentoring-future-computational-power-women-for-gci-2013/">here's a blog post by one of our mentors, Anna Belak</a>.</p>
